# SpaceDay

A web applicaiton using React and the NASA API to display the "Astrological Picture of the Day". Allows users to enter a desired date and show the NASA APOD for that particular date. 

Reflection: This web application was very elementary but it was a simple and easy way for me to learn how to handle API requests and display them on the front end of an application. With this knowledge, I was able to go on and create apps at a larger scale.
